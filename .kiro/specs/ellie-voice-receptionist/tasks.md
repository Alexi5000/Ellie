## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STATUS

The application is **production-ready** with complete deployment infrastructure:

### Development Environment:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Production Environment:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build
```

### SSL Setup (Production):

```bash
# Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File docker/ssl-setup.ps1

# Linux/Mac
bash docker/ssl-setup.sh
```

## 📋 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

To verify the implementation is working correctly:

- [ ] Run `npm run test` in both frontend and backend directories
- [ ] Run integration tests: `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Run production deployment tests: `npm run test:production`
